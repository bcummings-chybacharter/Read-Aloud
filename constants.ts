Its pages, thin as moth wings, held a story not of knights or dragons, but of a clockmaker who could wind back time, one tick at a time. He didn't use his gift for fame or fortune, but to relive the precious, fleeting moments with his daughter – a shared laugh, a bedtime story, the warmth of a small hand in his. The book didn't have an ending; it simply stopped, leaving the reader to wonder if the clockmaker was still there, lost in the beautiful, bittersweet loop of yesterday.`;
